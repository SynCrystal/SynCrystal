This data set contains two examples, one for Fig 12 and one for Fig 14 in the paper "PHASE SPACE SKETCHING FOR CRYSTAL IMAGE ANALYSIS BASED ON SYNCHROSQUEEZED TRANSFORMS" by Jianfeng Lu and H, aizhao Yang. Each example contains 4 different classes of crystal lattices. Each class contains 292 images of size 64 by 64 with different crystal orientation, translation, image intensity, deformation. We don't provide examples at different scale because there are bugs in the scattering transform package and we are not able to debug. Each class has 36 training images and the other 256 images are for validation purpose.
